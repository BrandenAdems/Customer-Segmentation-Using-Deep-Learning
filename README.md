# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Learning
Using Deep Learning method on customer segmentation dataset


## Description
The criteria of the project are as follows:
1) Develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow which only comprises of Dense, Dropout, and Batch Normalization layers.
2) The accuracy of the model must be more than 70%.
3) Display the training loss and accuracy on TensorBoard
4) Create modules (classes) for repeated functions to ease your training and testing process

The dataset can be obtained from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/customer-segmentation

## Results
There are 2 dataset which is customer_segmentation(train) and new_customers(test).
Train dataset consist of (8067 entries data with 11 columns) and test dataset consist of test.csv (2627 entries data with 11 columns)

The model consist of 3 dense layer and 1 output.

The model was called to train with an epochs of 250 and stop with the used of early stopping at 81 epochs. The accuracy and the loss are as follows
